    "# Using Pretrained Networks\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this lesson, you'll start to investigate how to use pretrained networks. Recall that when training neural networks, the model is tuning a huge number of weights: several to dozens at each individual layer. Often the largest limiting factor with these models is the quality and size of the training data you have at hand. As such, adapting a pretrained model from a similar problem context that was trained on a larger dataset can lead to stronger overall models when you have limited training data. For example, in image recognition, the VGG-19 network is commonly used to improve the model performance of CNNs with limited training data. VGG-19 was trained on the ImageNet dataset which contains approximately 1.2 million images. Since the initial bottom layers of a CNN pick up small details with later layers picking up larger and larger features, the initial layers of a well trained network are applicable to other problem domains. Similar pretrained networks exist for other domains such as natural language processing as well. With that, let's take a further look at how transfer learning works in detail.\n",

    "- Describe the benefits of using pretrained networks \n",

    "\n",
    "## Why are pretrained convolutional bases useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used approach when performing deep learning on fairly small image datasets is to use pretrained networks. A pretrained network is a network which was previously ran on a large, general dataset, and saved. The advantage is that the hierarchical features learned by this network can act as a generic model, and can be used for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, even if your new problem involves completely different classes of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from earlier that more general features such as edges are detected in earlier layers. Due to this, these convolution layers are highly generic and reusable. Layers that are further down the model extract more abstract concepts, so for new datasets with very different objects to classify, you might want to use only the first layers of the model, and not the entire convolutional base. \n"

    "You can find an overview here too: https://keras.io/applications/ \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these pretrained models, you can look at their structure. You can simply import the desired pretrained model, and use it as a function with two arguments: `weights` and `include_top`. Use `'imagenet'` in weights in order to use the weights that were obtained when training on the ImageNet dataset. You can choose to include the top of the model (whether or not to include the fully-connected layer at the top of the network), through the argument `include_top`. Here, we'll have a look at the structure of the MobileNet neural network. "

Why use convolutional base but *new* dense classifier? Generally, patterns learned by the convolutional layers are more generalizable.\n",

This solution is pretty fast to run, and you need to run the convolutional base first for every input image. The problem here is, however, that you can't use data augmentation as we've seen before.\n",

This way, you can use data augmentation, but as every input image goes through the convolutional base every time, this technique is much more time-consuming.

In addition, fine tuning also works by retraining the frozen weights for the convolutional base. This allows these weights to be tweaked for the current scenario, hence the name. To do this, you'll freeze part of the model while tuning specific layers. \n",

    "In this lesson we introduced the concept of using pretrained neural networks as a starting point for future models. The idea is that well trained CNNs have generalized visual patterns that are transferable to new applications. For example, a previously trained model might have hidden convolutional layers that effectively identify edges, or even more complex patterns such as eyes which may have value in new domains. In the upcoming lab, we'll further explore how to implement these concepts in Keras."
